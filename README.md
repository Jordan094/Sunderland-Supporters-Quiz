## Colour Pallete

![Sunderland Supporters Quiz Colour Pallette]()
[Pallette Created Using Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/)

I have chosen the above colour pallette as I wanted to stay true to the colours of the Sunderland AFC team Red being the primary colour and White the secondary. I chose neutral gray colours to make sure there was no clashes. I have also used the Coolors contrast checker to ensure these are suitable.

## Typography

I have chosen the Fira-Sans Font. This is provided by Google Fonts and [can be found here.](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Sans)

I have used the regular font weight for standard text and chosen a weight of 600 when adding emphasis such as on the heading and title text.

I have selected sans-serif to be the default font if Firs Sans can not be loaded.
