# **Design**

## Colour Pallete

![Sunderland Supporters Quiz Colour Pallette]()
[Pallette Created Using Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/)

I have chosen the above colour pallette as I wanted to stay true to the colours of the Sunderland AFC team Red being the primary colour and White the secondary. I chose neutral gray colours to make sure there was no clashes. I have also used the Coolors contrast checker to ensure these are suitable.

## Typography

I have chosen the Fira-Sans Font. This is provided by Google Fonts and [can be found here.](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Sans)

I have used the regular font weight for standard text and chosen a weight of 600 when adding emphasis such as on the heading and title text.

I have selected sans-serif to be the default font if Firs Sans can not be loaded.

## Images Used

Due to the nature of the website and quiz game I have only used one image as a background. Which has been provided by [Sky Sports.](https://www.skysports.com/)

The background image was originally in colour however I changed altered the image in photoshop to black and white to stay true to the colour scheme and avoid clashes that would make parts of the quiz unreadable.

## Icons

I have used fontawesome icons for the volume on and off icons and also the external link icons where are present in the footer.

# **Structure**

# **Wireframes**

Here are all of the wireframes designed for this page broken down into device level. I desgined these wireframes with mobile first in mind and due to the nature of the site and the size of the content there was no changes needed to be made in terms of content displayed so I have combined my mobile and tablet wireframes into one.

## Website Layout

The Website/Quiz has been designed using HTML5, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap 5 with a mobile first approach
All the main content of the website and quiz is present on the index.html page. the only other page is the 404 page.

* The website contains a homepage and a 404 page.
  * Homepage - This is the only page the user will need. The whole quiz game is held in a container on this page a footer at the bottom.
  * Quiz Section - The quiz section is on the home page. It has been designed to be used on a single page. I will break the sections of the quiz down further on the features section of this document.
  * 404 Page - A page I do not intend users to find. This page should only be displayed when there is a broken URL.


## Footer

![Footer Styles](placeholder)
The footer for the website is simple and clean and easy for the user to understand. There will be contact icons incase the user has an issue and also a share icon to share the url with friends.

# Features

## Sections

As the Sunderland Supporters Quiz is on one single page all the sections found on the page need to be activated by the user. As a default. Depending on the choice of the user. Certain functions will be ran that show the user different parts of the quiz.

### Main Menu Screen
![Responsive image placeholder](/assets/readme-files/design/Responsive_Menu_Screen.png)
This is the first screen that the user will see when visting the URL. The user will have a choice of three menu selections: The play game, highscores and lastly the instructions. There will also be a mute button which is constantly present.

### Instructions Section
![Responsive image placeholder](/assets/readme-files/design/Responsive_Instructions_Screen.png)
The instructions section is at the bottom of the menu screen. The rationale behind this choice of placement is that although new users will likely visit that section first. Returning users will have little to no use for that menu screen. The layout is very simple and to the point and clearly explains to the user how the game is played and how their scores will be calculated.

### Highscores Section
![Responsive image placeholder](/assets/readme-files/design/Responsive_Scores_Screen.png)
The highscores section is the middle choice on the menu selection screen. The rationale behind this choice of placement is that after the user has played and completed a game they will be curious to how their score competes with other players. The highscores itself is a simple table which shows the username of the play and the score they recieved it is displayed with the highest score at the top and the lowest at the bottom. To keep in theme with the Sunderland AFC colours I have made the table display in red and white.

### Enter Username
![Responsive image placeholder](/assets/readme-files/design/Responsive_Username_Screen.png)
The play game button takes the user to a simple username input screen. The user is then presented with 2 options. Start the game or return to the main menu. The name field is a required input and the user will need to input a username or the game will not let them continue.

### Play Game (The Quiz Itself)
![Responsive image placeholder](/assets/readme-files/design/Responsive_Game_Screen.png)
When the user inputs a username and presses start game the quiz will begin. The user will be presented with a total of 20 questions. The questions all have a total of 4 possible answers, only 1 will be correct. The user will be given an audible feedback if the answered the selected is correct or incorrect. The correct noise is a positive chime. The incorrect answer plays a thud sound. The user will be presented with a total of 20 questions to complete the quiz. The questions will be displayed in a random order.

### Game Complete (The Quiz Itself)
![Responsive image placeholder](/assets/readme-files/design/Responsive_Complete_Screen.png)
Once the quiz is complete the user will be given imediate feedback as to how many questions out of the total 20 they got correct. The users score will also be logged to the highscores at this point and the user will be thanked for playing.

There will only be 1 choice and that is for the user to return to the main menu screen.

# **Technologies Used**

  * HTML was used to create my quiz
* [CSS3](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp)
  * CSS was used to style my quiz
* [Javascript]
  * Javascript was used to add functionality to my quiz
* [GitHub](https://github.com/)
  * I used github to create my repository and store my projects code.
* [Code Anywhere](https://app.codeanywhere.com/)
  * I used Code Anywhere as my IDE
* [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/)
  * I tested my website and responsiveness throught creation using chrome developer tools.
* [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)
  * Balsamiq was used to create the wireframes during the design process.
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
  * I used the font Fira Sans which is a Google font, with a fallback font of Sans-Serif thoughout my whole project.
* [Am I Responsive?](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive)
  * This was used to test the responsiveness on all devices once the pages were complete.

# **Accessibility**

I wanted to ensure that the website was fully accessible. I have done this by doing the following:

* Providing Alternative Text (Alt Text)
  * I've made sure to add descriptive alternative text (alt text) to all images on the website. Alt text adds context to images, enabling users who rely on screen readers to understand the visual content even if they can't see it.
* Ensuring Color Contrast
  * I've chosen color combinations that maintain accessible contrast ratios, ensuring that text remains readable against different background colors. This benefits users with visual impairments or color blindness.
* Responsive Design
  * The site is designed to adapt to various devices and screen sizes. This caters to users who rely on different devices or have specific accessibility requirements.
