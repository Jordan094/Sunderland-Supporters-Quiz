## Colour Pallete

![Sunderland Supporters Quiz Colour Pallette]()
[Pallette Created Using Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/)

I have chosen the above colour pallette as I wanted to stay true to the colours of the Sunderland AFC team Red being the primary colour and White the secondary. I chose neutral gray colours to make sure there was no clashes. I have also used the Coolors contrast checker to ensure these are suitable.

## Typography

I have chosen the Fira-Sans Font. This is provided by Google Fonts and [can be found here.](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Sans)

I have used the regular font weight for standard text and chosen a weight of 600 when adding emphasis such as on the heading and title text.

I have selected sans-serif to be the default font if Firs Sans can not be loaded.

## Images Used

Due to the nature of the website and quiz game I have only used one image as a background. Which has been provided by [Sky Sports.](https://www.skysports.com/)

The background image was originally in colour however I changed altered the image in photoshop to black and white to stay true to the colour scheme and avoid clashes that would make parts of the quiz unreadable.

## Icons

I have used fontawesome icons for the volume on and off icons and also the external link icons where are present in the footer.

# **Structure**

## Website Layout

The Website/Quiz has been designed using HTML5, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap 5 with a mobile first approach
All the main content of the website and quiz is present on the index.html page. the only other page is the 404 page.

* The website contains a homepage and a 404 page.
  * Homepage - This is the only page the user will need. The whole quiz game is held in a container on this page a footer at the bottom.
  * Quiz Section - The quiz section is on the home page. It has been designed to be used on a single page. I will break the sections of the quiz down further on the features section of this document.
  * 404 Page - A page I do not intend users to find. This page should only be displayed when there is a broken URL.


## Footer
